		<strong>Initialization:</strong><br>

		&rarr; Every project and lecturer is unsubscribed (no provisional assignments).<br><br>
	
		The algorithm iterates over each <strong>free student</strong>:
		<ul>
		  <li>Each student proposes to their highest ranked project, not yet rejected <br>
			Projects go through all their assignments, keeping the higher preferred students.
		</li>
		  <li> Here there could be two cases : 
			<ul>
			  <li>The proposed projects |assigned| = available slots <br>
				→ what is done here is, we go through all assignments of those projects<br>
				 and get the least ranked student among them. <br>
				 — If the lowest ranked student’s rank is higher than(as in number) <br>
				 than the current student who proposed, the least student is removed from <br>
				 the projects assigned list and the current student is added. The least ranked <br>
				 student is added back to the free students list. The current student is removed from the free students list.
				— If the student ranks lesser than the least ranked student, then the project is skipped. I.e, the student is rejected
				</li>
			  <li>The proposed project has space, then the student is accepted by the project. Thereby the size of project’s assigned increases by 1. 
			</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		</ul>
		This continues until : 
				All students are assigned
				Or all the projects in the preference list are exhausted 
		<br>
		Outcome  : <strong>Student-optimal</strong>: Each student gets the best project they can get in any stable matching. 
		<br> Projects might get less-preferred students
