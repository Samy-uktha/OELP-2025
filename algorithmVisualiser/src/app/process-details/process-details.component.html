		&rarr; <strong>Phase 1:  Project proposal phase<br></strong>
		

	
		In the Proposal Phase, faculty members submit their project proposals through the 
		portal. Each project includes a detailed title, description, expected outcomes, the 
		number of available slots, and eligibility criteria such as required CGPA, 
		department, year of study, and prerequisite courses. This phase ensures that all project 
		offerings are finalized before students begin applying. Faculty can edit or delete their
		proposals during this phase, and the system ensures that only valid and complete
		entries are published for student view. <br><br>

		&rarr; <strong>Phase 2:  Student Application Phase<br></strong>
		

	
		Once the Proposal Phase ends, the Application Phase begins. During this period,
		students can browse through the list of available OELPs and apply to the projects
		they are eligible for. The portal automatically filters projects based on each studentâ€™s
		academic profile, including CGPA, department, semester, and completed courses.
		Students are required to submit a short bio, a statement of purpose explaining why
		they are interested in the project, and can optionally upload supporting documents
		like resumes or project portfolios. Students may apply to multiple projects during
		this phase.<br><br>

		&rarr; <strong>Phase 3:  Preferences Setting Phase<br></strong>
		After applications have been submitted, both students and faculty enter the Preference Setting Phase. Here, students must rank the projects they have applied to in
		order of preference. Similarly, faculty members rank the students who have applied
		to their projects based on academic credentials and the submitted application. The
		preference data from both sides plays a critical role in the subsequent allocation process. This phase ensures mutual prioritization and gives both students and faculty
		a degree of control in the matching.<br><br>

		&rarr; <strong>Phase 4: Allocation Phase<br></strong>
		In the final Allocation Phase, the system uses a backend algorithm (e.g., Boston
		Mechanism or Gale-Shapley Stable Matching) to assign students to projects. The
		algorithm takes into account the preferences from both students and faculty, along
		with eligibility and slot constraints. Once the allocations are finalized, the results are
		published on the portal. Students and faculty can view their respective matches, and
		admins may intervene only in special cases where manual overrides are necessary.
		This phase concludes the allotment cycle.
