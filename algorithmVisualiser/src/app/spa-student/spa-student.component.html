		<strong>Initialization:</strong><br>
		&rarr; All students start free and unassigned.<br>
		&rarr; Every project and lecturer is unsubscribed (no provisional assignments).<br><br>
	
		Initially all students are free, and all projects and lecturers are totally unsubscribed.
		 As long as there is some student 𝑠𝑖 who is free and who has a non-empty preference list,
		  𝑠𝑖 applies to the first project 𝑝𝑗 on his/her list. We let 𝑙𝑘 be the lecturer who offers 𝑝𝑗. 
		  Immediately, 𝑠𝑖 becomes provisionally assigned to 𝑝𝑗 (and to 𝑙𝑘). <br> <br>

		  If 𝑝𝑗 is over-subscribed, then the worst student 𝑠𝑟 assigned to 𝑝𝑗 is rejected. The pair 
		  (𝑠𝑟,𝑝𝑗) will be deleted by the subsequent conditional that tests for 𝑝𝑗 being full. The pair (𝑠𝑟,𝑝𝑡) 
		  will be deleted by either of the two subsequent conditionals, where 𝑝𝑡 was the project most recently assigned 𝑠𝑟.
		  <br> <br>

		  If the project is full (i.e., at capacity), the lecturer removes from the project's preference <br>
		   list all students less preferred than the worst currently assigned student.

		   <br> <br>
		   The algorithm ends when every free student has an empty preference list (i.e. cannot propose any further)
		    or all students have been provisionally assigned. The final matching is then the set of provisional assignments.

			<strong>Outcome : Student optimal </strong>  allocations (i.e., it prioritises the student preferences over faculty)
